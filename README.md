## **OpenArenaNX-Spearmint - Experimental Splitscreen Build**
A port of ioquake3 + OpenArena for the Nintendo Switch. Compatible with both controllers and keyboard + mouse controls! Based off of ioquake3 1.36 and OpenArena 3.00a. Also includes a q3a branch for playing regular Quake III Arena.

### ***"Why? Doesn't ioquake3-nx already exist?"***
It does, and this project uses some of it's code! But the releases requires a copy of baseq3 (which is non-free) to launch, so this fork tweaks a few variables to launch OpenArena (a free clone) as a standalone game. Also includes engine improvements from Spearmint for 2-4 player local splitscreen, improving it's enjoyability as a Switch title.

## **Installation (DOES NOT WORK YET, NO SUCCESSFUL BUILDS EXIST AS OF THIS MESSAGE!)**
- Latest full build including game files can be downloaded and copied from <a href="https://accela.design/downloads/switch-homebrew/OpenArenaNX-Spearmint.zip">here!<br/></a>

## **Original ReadMe**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zturtleman/spearmint/master/misc/spearmint_text.png" width="256">

**Spearmint** is a fork of [ioquake3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3) with two main goals; 1) provide a flexible engine for creating new games and mods, 2) support features from (and running) various id Tech 3-based games.

Spearmint can be used to play Quake III Arena, Quake III: Team Arena, and Turtle Arena. Progress has been made toward running Return to Castle Wolfenstein (MP) and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory but there is still quite a bit left before it's possible. Spearmint is not compatible with existing mods (the QVM/DLL files) or demos (game recordings) for any game.

New Spearmint major releases (X.0.0) will break VM and network compatibility with previous releases.

The source code for the Spearmint Quake 3 game, cgame, and ui code and QVM compiler is at [zturtleman/mint-arena](https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/). Map editor and map compiler are available at https://icculus.org/gtkradiant/.
